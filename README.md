# The Advent of Code - in Lavender!
Advent of Code puzzle solvers, written in Lavender. Each year, I solve the Advent of Code using the Lavender programming language, mainly to show that it can actually do things.

This year (2020), Rusty-Lavender is unfortunately not ready to be used for AoC, so I am doing this year in Haskell, the language closest to Lavender in syntax.
